 title={{Fast Point Transformer}},
 author={Chunghyun Park and Yoonwoo Jeong and Minsu Cho and Jaesik Park},
 abstract={The recent success of neural networks enables a better interpretation of 3D point clouds, but processing a large-scale 3D scene remains a challenging problem. Most current approaches divide a large-scale scene into small regions and combine the local predictions together. However, this scheme inevitably involves additional stages for pre- and post-processing and may also degrade the final output due to predictions in a local perspective. This paper introduces Fast Point Transformer that consists of a new lightweight self-attention layer. Our approach encodes continuous 3D coordinates, and the voxel hashing-based architecture boosts computational efficiency. The proposed method is demonstrated with 3D semantic segmentation and 3D detection. The accuracy of our approach is competitive to the best voxel-based method, and our network achieves 129 times faster inference time than the state-of-the-art, Point Transformer, with a reasonable accuracy trade-off in 3D semantic segmentation on S3DIS dataset.},

  title={PointMixer: MLP-Mixer for Point Cloud Understanding},
  author={Jaesung Choe* and Chunghyun Park* and Francois Rameau and Jaesik Park and In So Kweon},
  abstract={MLP-Mixer has newly appeared as a new challenger against the realm of CNNs and Transformer. Despite its simplicity compared to Transformer, the concept of channel-mixing MLPs and token-mixing MLPs achieves noticeable performance in image recognition tasks. Unlike images, point clouds are inherently sparse, unordered and irregular, which limits the direct use of MLP-Mixer for point cloud understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose PointMixer, a universal point set operator that facilitates information sharing among unstructured 3D point cloud. By simply replacing token-mixing MLPs with Softmax function, PointMixer can “mix” features within/between point sets. By doing so, PointMixer can be broadly used for intra-set, inter-set, and hierarchical-set mixing. We demonstrate that various channel-wise feature aggregation in numerous point sets is better than self-attention layers or dense token-wise interaction in a view of parameter efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments show the competitive or superior performance of PointMixer in semantic segmentation, classification, and reconstruction against Transformer-based methods.},

  abstract={Although great advances in artificial intelligence for interpreting small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) images have been made in recent years, its practical use is still limited. The aim of this study was to develop a more practical convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for the automatic detection of various small bowel lesions.},
