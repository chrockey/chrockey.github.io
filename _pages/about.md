I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in [Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.postech.ac.kr/) at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/).
I am a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) at POSTECH, advised by Prof. [Jaesik Park](https://jaesik.info/).
Previously, I completed my B.S in Mechanical Engineering and M.S in Artificial Intelligence at POSTECH. \

My research topics of interest include computer vision, 3D vision, and 3D reconstruction.
I am particularly interested in 3D perception on point clouds for applications in autonomous vehicles and robotics.
If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me in one of the following ways.
