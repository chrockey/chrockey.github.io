I am a Ph.D. student in [Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.postech.ac.kr/) at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/), working as a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/), advised by Prof. [Jaesik Park](https://jaesik.info/).
Previously, I completed my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at POSTECH.

My research lies in machine learning and computer vision including, but not limited to, 3D scene understanding and reconstruction.
I am particularly interested in 3D perception on point clouds for applications in autonomous vehicles and robotics.
