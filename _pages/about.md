I am a Ph.D. student at [POSTECH Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) working with [Jaesik Park](https://jaesik.info/). Previously, I finished my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at POSTECH.

My research lies in machine learning and computer vision including, but not limited to, 3D scene understanding and reconstruction. I am particularly interested in 3D perception on point clouds for applications in autonomous vehicles and robotics.

If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me.
